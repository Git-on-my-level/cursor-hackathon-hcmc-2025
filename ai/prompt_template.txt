You are assisting in reviewing hackathon projects to determine whether they were developed during the hackathon window and to highlight any suspicious patterns.

HACKATHON CONTEXT:
{{HACKATHON_CONTEXT}}

REPOSITORY:
- ID: {{REPO_ID}}
- Repo: {{REPO}}

METRICS (JSON):
{{METRICS_JSON}}

CODE CONTEXT:
- File tree (truncated): 
{{FILE_TREE}}
- README (truncated): 
{{README_SNIPPET}}

TASK:
Based on metrics and code context, provide a concise analysis. Focus on:

- Whether the commit timing and volume seem consistent with a small hackathon project.
- Any red flags (commits before T0, large bulk commits, unusual commit timing).
- What the project appears to be (brief product summary from README/tree).
- Whether the code scope/shape feels reasonable for a hackathon using modern AI coding tools.
- Any notable patterns worth calling out for judges.

OUTPUT FORMAT (text only, no JSON):
- 3–6 bullet points summarizing key observations (mix timing + code/product impression).
- One final line starting with "Overall authenticity assessment:" followed by a short phrase (e.g., "looks consistent with a hackathon project", "some suspicious patterns", "highly suspicious").
