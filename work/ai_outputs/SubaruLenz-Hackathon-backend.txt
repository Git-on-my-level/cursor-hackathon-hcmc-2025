- Commit activity is confined to the hackathon window (five commits from 0–6h with ~48‑minute medians, no pre‑t0 or bulk commits), so timing/volume looks normal for a small team sprint.  
- Project is a FastAPI “Budget Tracker API” with spendings CRUD plus summary and visualization endpoints, backed by SQLAlchemy models, migrations, and lightweight docs (see `app/routers/spendings.py` and `migrations/sql/*`).  
- Code scope is reasonable for a hackathon: data validation via Pydantic, service/storage separation, and category/percentage calculations for visualization—nothing too polished or overengineered.  
- Recent work added Tailscale/Docker deployment instructions (`DOCKER_README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`) and visualization enhancements, which feel like incremental stretch goals common in live contests rather than evidence of prep work.  
Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
