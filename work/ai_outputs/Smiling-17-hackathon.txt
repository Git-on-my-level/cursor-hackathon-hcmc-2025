- Commit activity is limited to two pushes 37 seconds apart (2025-11-29 18:52:18 and 18:52:55 +07:00) inside the hackathon window; the reported median gap of 0.62 minutes matches this burst, so the recorded history is extremely dense but lacks gradual iteration.
- The first commit dumps 81 files—including the full Next.js frontend/backend and several `backend/PersonB_Code_*.zip` bundles—followed by a second commit that only removes a handful of README-style notes; that “all at once” package drop plus doc cleanup is unusual for a working-in-progress timeline and looks more like shipping a finished package than evolving it live.
- The product presented is “CyberGuard AI,” a Next.js dashboard with hero stats, quick tool cards, and multi-scan CTAs for image/audio/video threats (see `frontend/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx:1`), while the backend offers a manual test harness that hits `/api/health`, `/api/scan-image`, and `/api/scan-video` endpoints explained right in `backend/app/page.tsx:1`.
- The code shape is a full-stack Next.js implementation with symmetric frontend/backend scanners and shared Groq helpers (e.g., the image scan route scaffolding in `frontend/app/api/scan-image/route.ts:1` and its backend counterpart in `backend/app/api/scan-image/route.ts:1`), so the scope of work is technically plausible for a hackathon but entirely surfaced in those two commits.
