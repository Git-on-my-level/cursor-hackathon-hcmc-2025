- Commit cadence is aggressive for the 6-hour window (median ~3.7 minutes, six commits between ~07:25 and ~13:21 UTC), which is plausible for a small team sprint but the biggest “Add backend”-style commit (~28K LOC) came right after the T1 cutoff and 6 more commits flowed in post‑event, so judges might flag the post‑deadline bulk work even though during-window activity wasn’t zero.
- Flags from the metrics—no commits before T0, a “large initial commit after T0,” and a merge—line up: the repo appears to have been bootstrapped from Nest/Next templates and then merged in a single feature branch at ~19:08 +0700, so watch for those template dumps masking actual hackathon effort.
- The product looks like an AI-powered HR analytics cockpit branded as Luminus.ai, with storytelling on `frontend/app/page.tsx` about team/dynamic analytics, burnout detection, and secure deployment, backed by a Next.js landing page with framer-motion polish and Lucide icons.
- The codebase spans a Nest backend and Next frontend (and shared `lib/ai-*` helpers), suggesting they aimed for a full-stack workforce intelligence experience; structure and tooling (motion, lucide, defaults) fit a modern AI-assisted sprint, though some README files still contain default boilerplate.
