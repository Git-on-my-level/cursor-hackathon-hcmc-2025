- All eight commits occurred within the official window [t0–t1], so no commits before or after the hackathon; timing and frequency (median ~8 minutes apart) look tense but not impossible for a sprint.
- The report flags a massive bulk addition (max +77k LOC, 325 files) and the project’s origin from a complete `create-t3-turbo` starter, suggesting the repo was mostly scaffolded in one shot rather than hand-assembled during the event.
- No merges, no outside activity; code scope matches a full-stack Turbo monorepo (Next.js, Expo, shared tooling, Supabase/Drizzle) described in the README, i.e., a substantial product template rather than a lightweight hackathon build.
- The sheer volume of generated/template code makes it hard to gauge new substance, and the large initial commit after T0 is a red flag for authenticity since it’s unlikely to be handwritten in a short window.
- Using modern AI tooling could explain rapid scaffold creation, but the combination of a monorepo starter plus a single massive commit, rather than incremental feature work, warrants caution.

Overall authenticity assessment: some suspicious patterns
