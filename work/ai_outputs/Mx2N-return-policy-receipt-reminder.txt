- Single monolithic commit (1 total, all within the 3–6 h window) added ~2.6K LOC across only three files, which triggered the “large initial commit” flag but still feels plausible for a focused hackathon upload rather than a long-running repo.
- UI/UX is a “Return Date Tracker” dashboard with modals for uploading receipts, export/clear buttons, and settings surfaced from `index.html:1`, so the product goal is clear and ties directly to the hackathon prompt.
- `script.js:1` implements OCR with Tesseract, AI parsing toggle, configurable store policies, email reminders (EmailJS), manual overrides, and a CSV export/clear flow, showing non-trivial logic that matches the described feature set.
- Absence of README/history beyond the bulk upload makes provenance harder to trace, but the single-commit timeline and contained code base still align with a rapid prototyping session using modern AI tooling.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
