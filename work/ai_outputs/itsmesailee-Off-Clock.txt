- Only one commit (the initial one) landed at 11:04 UTC, well inside the 06–12 hack window with no prior history, so the timing/volume fit a single-session sprint even though the bulk-change flag tripped because the whole experience landed at once.
- The repo is essentially a two-page cinematic experience plus audio: `fullscreen.html:1` encodes the 90-second “Off Clock” ritual with animated gradients, stage-based breathing cues, fade-to-black finale, and background music (`Ritual.mp3`), while `fullscreen copy.html:1` provides a polished fullscreen prompt—both consistent with a focused visual prototype.
- Documentation is minimal (just three repeated heading lines in `README.md:1-3`), so there’s little project narrative, but that’s not unusual for a hackathon submission where the UI/UX itself tells the story.
- Single-volume delivery is the main oddity, yet given the compact scope and the fact that modern AI-assisted dev can spin out HTML/CSS/JS swiftly, the shape feels reasonable for a solo or duo race.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
