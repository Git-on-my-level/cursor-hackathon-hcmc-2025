- All 11 commits are within the hackathon window (t0–t1) with no pre-event history, so timing aligns with a short sprint, though the median ~27-minute spacing and most activity in the first 6 hours suggests a focused, compressed effort.  
- The metrics flag a large bulk commit with ~6.8k lines added and a max of 17 files changed, which is typical when scaffolding a full-stack UI quickly—worth flagging in reviews but not necessarily suspicious on its own.  
- The repo is a Next.js/React dashboard (“Cursor Sharing”) that showcases community AI workflows, with components like Dashboard, Leaderboard, ShareSetup, and API folders, matching the README description and supporting a hackathon-style MVP.  
- The scope (static data pages, leaderboard, share page, simple cache utility) feels achievable within a hackathon and consistent with modern AI coding tooling (e.g., generating UI components, rapid Next.js setup).  
- No evidence of post-event or pre-event commits, no merge commits, and the structure is coherent; the only pattern worth noting is the sizable initial commit, which might carry generated boilerplate but otherwise fits a rapid prototype.  

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
