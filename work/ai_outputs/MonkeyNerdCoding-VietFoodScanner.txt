- All five commits happened between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC (Git log shows timestamps 15:00‑17:49 +07) with a median gap of about 20 minutes and none before or after the window, matching the metrics’ “during event” badge and showing activity consistent with a single-team sprint rather than prework.
- `README.md:1-115` describes “Pho-tographer,” a mobile-first Vietnamese street-food scanner powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, with camera/upload capture, multi-language descriptions, pronunciation help, and celebratory UI flourishes—so the deliverable is a full-stack food decoder experience finished in the hack window.
- `README.md:89-115` and the tree confirm React/Vite frontend components (camera, home, loading, result card, language switcher) alongside a simple Express backend, supporting the claim that the project spans both UI and API layers within a typical hackathon scope.
- The backend (`server.js:1-85`) exposes `/api/identify`, handles multipart/base64 payloads, and delegates to `gemini-api-utils.js`, showing the team wired up the Gemini inference path and health-check endpoint during the event.
- The “First Looking of UI” commit added ~5,465 lines (components, config, assets, package-lock) in one go, then subsequent commits iterated on the result card and polish; the large initial bulk is noticeable but matches an initial MVP drop followed by refinements, so nothing obviously anomalous beyond the expected volume for a 6-hour push.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
