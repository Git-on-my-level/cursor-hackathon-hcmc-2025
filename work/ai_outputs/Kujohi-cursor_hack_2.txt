- Timing fits a focused sprint: all four commits touch the repo within a single day, three (with a 6.25‑minute median gap) fall squarely inside the 06:00‑12:00 UTC window, but the latest push (30de8f7) lands at ~12:29 UTC—just after T1—so judges should note that polish came post deadline.  
- Bulk commit behavior is flagged: one snapshot adds ~3,341 LOC across 14 files, so confirm this isn’t pre-prepared work slipped in, but since it’s also during the 3‑6h period it may simply be aggressive feature expansion.  
- Product intent (per the README and `App.tsx`) is “DisasterConnect,” an AI Studio/React front end that streams Gemini voice calls into a dispatcher, shows incidents on a Leaflet map, and lists reports in a floating card.  
- Code scope is reasonable for a hackathon using modern tooling: React + Tailwind UI, real-time Leaflet map, an audio visualizer, and lightweight state for reports; no backend beyond calling Gemini Live—manageable in a few hours.  
- Notable pattern: `GeminiLiveService` in `services/geminiService.ts` wires up audio capture, Gemini Live tool calls, and fallback location logic, showing they leaned on AI tooling for the bulk of logic while keeping the UI snug around it.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
