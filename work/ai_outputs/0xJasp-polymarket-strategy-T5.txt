- Timing metrics show nine commits exclusively between T0 and T1 with a ~14.7‑minute median spacing and nothing before or after, matching the rhythm of a single intense 6‑hour sprint.
- The `has_bulk_commits` flag reflects the ~2.8K LOC added across the project, but those additions were still spread across the event’s first six hours (1 commit in 0‑3h, 8 in 3‑6h) rather than being backdated, so the volume doesn’t feel like a stealthy prework.
- Docs (`replit.md:3`) describe a Node.js CLI that identifies the five top weekly‑profit Polymarket traders, fetches their last 7 days of trades, and asks Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to explain their strategy for novice traders.
- The main script (`index.js:6`) implements that flow—pulling high‑volume markets, scraping holders and trades, computing weekly profit, ranking the top five, and feeding trade summaries into Gemini—so the code matches the doc’s scope and is achievable with modern AI tooling.
- A complementary Express server (`server.js:1`) largely reuses the same logic to present a styled dashboard and refresh controls, signaling quick polish around the core analyst rather than a complex backend stack.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
