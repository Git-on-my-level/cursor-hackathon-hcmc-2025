- Commit timing looks consistent with a focused weekend effort: only two commits, both within the hackathon window (one in 0‑3h, one in 3‑6h), median spacing ≈62 min, and no history before T0; metrics flag a single large bulk add (~3.5k LOC) but that can still come from a concentrated build step rather than pre-existing work.
- Product intent is clear from `README.md:1-34`: an AI Prompt Optimizer web app built with React/Vite/Tailwind + Express, offering Gemini-powered prompt analysis, automatic optimization, visual metrics, and a polished UI/animation layer.
- Frontend wiring (`src/App.jsx:1-110`) feeds the `/api/analyze-and-optimize` endpoint, renders animations/UI states, and surfaces analysis/optimized prompts; the backend (`server/index.js:1-120` and `server/services/geminiService.js:1-133`) provides Express routes plus Gemini calls that analyze prompts, normalize scores, and regenerate improved prompts in response.
- Notable pattern: no merges, just two straight commits, and the reported “bulk” commit is the initial code drop—this matches a single pass of scaffolding plus feature wiring typical for hackathon pacing, though it’s worth noting for reviewers that nearly all work landed in that one sweep.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project.
