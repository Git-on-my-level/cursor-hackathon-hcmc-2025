- Two commits, both during the hack window, add ~5.2K LOC with a bulky first change (3.5K LOC, 16 files)—matches a single intense hack surge rather than gradual polish, which is typical for short events especially if scaffolding and assets are added up front.
- No commits before T0 or after T1, so timing doesn’t raise red flags beyond the large initial dump; median spacing (~62 min) also aligns with focused bursts.
- Repository is a React/Vite/Tailwind UI plus Express backend that integrates Gemini for prompt analysis/optimization—README, file tree, and config files all describe a cohesive “AI Prompt Optimizer” experience with frontend animations and backend API hooks.
- Code scope (UI components, API config, Express server with Gemini service) is reasonable for a hackathon, leveraging existing tools/plugins rather than reinventing infrastructure; commits suggest the team scaffolded a modern stack and wired API interactions in a single sprint.
- Notable pattern: a big initial commit followed by a single follow-up; while bulk commits can obscure intermediate work, no other anomalies (e.g., hidden histories) are evident from provided data.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
