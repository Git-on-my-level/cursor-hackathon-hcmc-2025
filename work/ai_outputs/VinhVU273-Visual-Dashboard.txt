- Single commit `841745d` timestamped Sat Nov 29 17:33 +07:00 (≈10:33 UTC) falls squarely inside the 06:00–12:00 window, and the provided metrics show exactly one commit during the event with none before/after, so the crude timeline matches the hackathon span.  
- Metrics flag this as a bulk/large initial commit (8 117 LOC across 26 files) with no incremental checkpoints; that’s a red flag worth noting for judges because it’s harder to verify on-the-fly development versus someone dropping in a finished project.  
- The README pitches an “Interactive Video Dashboard” with infinite canvas placement, inline playback, floating notes, presentation mode, drag-and-drop uploads, local save state, and Gemini-powered video analysis (see `README.md:3-102`).  
- Code structure mirrors that pitch: `src/store.ts:1-200` wires Zustand state, localStorage persistence, video management, and a Gemini-powered `analyzeVideos` flow that extracts frames before calling `src/services/geminiService.ts:1-171`, which orchestrates the Google Generative AI client for per-video analysis and cross-video theme summarization.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
