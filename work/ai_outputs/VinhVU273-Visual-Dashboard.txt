- Timing/volume: metrics show a single commit during the 3–6 h window with 8.1K LOC across 26 files, no work before T0 or after T1, and the repo is flagged for a bulk/large initial commit.  
- Red flag: no incremental commits—one big post-T0 push—so it’s hard to tell if the work genuinely unfolded during the hackathon or was developed elsewhere and dumped in once.  
- Product scope (README.md:1-103): describes an “Interactive Video Dashboard” with an infinite canvas, inline video playback, drag/drop uploads, floating notes, presentation mode, and Gemini-powered AI video analysis.  
- Code shape (src/services/geminiService.ts:1-170): modern React + Fabric + Zustand front end that hooks into Google Gemini to analyze frames and summarize common themes, which is an achievable but ambitious hackathon build.  
- Notable pattern: Gemini service orchestrates detailed prompt formatting, JSON parsing, and fallback handling, illustrating reliance on AI tooling for the core differentiator while keeping most logic client-side.
