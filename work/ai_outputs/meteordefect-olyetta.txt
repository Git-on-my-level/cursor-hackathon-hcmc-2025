- All 15 commits fall into the 06:00–12:00 UTC window (`total_commits_during_event=15`, zero before/after) with a 13.5 min median cadence and no merges, suggesting a focused single-session effort rather than pre-made work.  
- The bulk-commit warning appears tied to later-phase additions such as `feat: Complete Phase 5.5 – Hands-Free Continuous Conversation Mode`, but earlier commits show incremental scaffolding (auth, Supabase, mode setup), so the history reads like iterative hacking rather than copy-paste.  
- `README.md:1` pitches Olyetta as a desktop AI interviewer with Free Flow/Agenda/Drill modes, real-time voice, transcription, usage tracking, and Supabase auth, so the repo clearly targets that scope.  
- `src/components/Recorder.tsx:1` plus `src/hooks/use-silence-detection.ts:1` reveal a custom recorder/silence-detection workflow that ties into Next.js/Supabase utilities (`mode-config`, OpenAI helpers), aligning with the audio/AI-heavy feature set.  
- Backend support is sketched out in `supabase/schema.sql:1`, where profiles/usage tables are created, showing attention to the usage-tracking aspect the product touts.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
