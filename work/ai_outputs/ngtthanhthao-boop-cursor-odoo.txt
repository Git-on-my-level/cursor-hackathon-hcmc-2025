- Both recorded commits (`9c79f89` at 08:50 UTC and `fadce8e` at 08:53 UTC on Nov 29) fall squarely inside the 06:00‑12:00 UTC hackathon window, with only two commits 3.6 minutes apart and zero before/after, so timing-wise the work appears to have started and finished during the event.
- The `Add staff_manager module` push is effectively a single bulk commit that drops ~3.7k lines across 37 files (including `__pycache__`/`.pyc` artifacts), so there is no incremental trace of how the code evolved during the window—this lack of granularity and the presence of compiled files is worth flagging as a suspicious pattern for judges tracking provenance.
- The repository is an Odoo “Staff Manager” module (`custom_addons/staff_manager` and `__manifest__.py`) that supports employee records, call-history logging, import/export helpers, and a system-status toggle plus Excel templates, matching the README’s described scope.
- The implementation feels feasible for a hackathon build with modern AI coding help: `models/staff.py` adds phone validation, computed call stats, and logging; `models/call_log.py` enforces duration/status rules; `models/import_wizard.py` handles Excel import/templating with xlrd/xlsxwriter; and `models/system_status.py` is a simple on/off toggle with notifications—so the code size/shape is consistent with a bundled AI-assisted sprint.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
