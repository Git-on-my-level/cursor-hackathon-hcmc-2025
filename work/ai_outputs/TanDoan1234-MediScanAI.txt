- Commit cadence fits a hackathon burst: all 15 commits within window or shortly after, no pre-event history, median spacing ~15 min overall and ~5 min during official window, which matches rapid iteration.
- Flagged bulk work is real: a single event-epoch commit added 34k LOC across 37 files—suggests either autogenerated data load (e.g., drug databases) or a bulk import rather than incremental coding, so judges might want to verify its provenance but it didn’t precede T0.
- Product is a full-stack MediScan AI tool (Flask backend + React/Vite frontend) for scanning medicines, leveraging OCR and optionally Gemini API for summarization, plus a sizable crawled drug database.
- The code footprint (Backend services, OCR/lookup modules, Web UI components) aligns with a structured hackathon submission that likely leveraged modern AI/utility services; the README and folder tree describe realistic setup steps and components.
- Notable pattern: two commits after T1, so most work concludes during event; no evidence of prior work, but bulk data imports and merge commits warrant a quick spot-check for automation vs hands-on edits.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
