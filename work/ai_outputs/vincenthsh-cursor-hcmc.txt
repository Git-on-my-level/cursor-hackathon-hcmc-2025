- Commit cadence is extremely tight: 56 commits all within the 6-hour window (none before), with a median of ~0.58 minutes between commits, which feels unusually fast but plausible if one developer pushed frequently during the session; the only post-window commit is a single follow-up, so there isn’t evidence of late polishing.
- Metrics flag “bulk commits,” and there’s a single commit that added >5k LOC across 24 files; while large, that could reflect scaffolding generated by tools (configs, assets) rather than suspicious outside work—still worth a quick glance during judging.
- Codebase looks like a complete React+TypeScript multiplayer “Cacophony Game” with Supabase and Suno integrations, polished README/docs, and structured folder layout, which matches the README’s description of an AI-driven music battle game.
- Size and scope (front-end components, hooks, services, utils, docs, db scripts) are ambitious but reasonable for an intense team hackathon effort using modern generators and AI tooling to scaffold large chunks quickly; everything is in TypeScript with Tailwind/Vite, a typical modern stack.
- Notable pattern: the time distribution shows 16 commits in the first 3 hours and 40 in the next 3, suggesting the bulk of work was done in the latter half—could reflect ramp-up, or a burst once the setup was in place; no commits after 12h.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
