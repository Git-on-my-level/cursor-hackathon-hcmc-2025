- All five commits (latest hash `b9fcecc` at 2025‑11‑29 11:00 UTC) land inside the 06:00‑12:00 hackathon window, with a ~15‑minute median gap, so the activity timeline is consistent with a focused sprint and there are no pre‑ or post‑event pushes.  
- The first event commit already introduces ~6K LOC (per metrics) and touches 31 files, which is a big bulk add right after kickoff; while that can happen in hackathons when scaffolding a full React/Vite app, it is worth flagging because the bulk of the code appeared in one shot rather than gradually.  
- `README.md` outlines a React + Vite educational app with AI features (Gemini summaries, quiz generation, gamified dashboard, YouTube integration) and detailed local setup steps, showing the intended product scope is a kid-focused life skills platform with AI enrichment (`README.md:1-58`).  
- The source tree has a dozen specialized components (`components/` folder) plus hooks/services for progress and Gemini, so the codebase shape matches the described product and looks like work that can be produced in a few focused hours of modern AI-assisted front-end development.  
- No red flags about weird timing (all commits clustered in a 1‑hour window) or after-hours patches, and the mix of files suggests iterative refinement rather than automated mass imports.  

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
