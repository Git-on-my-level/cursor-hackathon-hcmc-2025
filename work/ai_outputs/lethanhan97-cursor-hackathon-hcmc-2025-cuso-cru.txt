- Commit cadence (18 commits, 0 before/after event, 16 in first 3h with a ~6.6-minute median gap) looks like a steady, real-time sprint rather than post-event backfill.
- No obvious red flags from the metrics: no pre-hackathon work, no huge bulk commits, no merge commits or after-window updates.
- `src/App.tsx:1` wires webcam + transcription + face detection into a “mood DJ” UI that plays mood-tagged background audio and SFX, so the product appears to be a live experience that reads expressions/transcript and responds with sound.
- `src/hooks/useMoodCalculation.ts:1` encapsulates smoothing+voice weighting, SFX keyword mapping, and threshold logic, keeping the emotion decision within scope for a compact hackathon build.
- `src/hooks/useAutoTranscription.ts:1` plus `server.ts:1` show a lightweight ElevenLabs token proxy powering real-time captions, which fits the tooling level expected from an agile jam session.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
