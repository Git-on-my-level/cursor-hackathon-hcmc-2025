- Commit timing/volume aligns with a quick build: only two commits (total 585 LOC) recorded between T0 and T1 with ~7.7 minutes median spacing, no history outside the window, no bulk/merge commits flagged, so the cadence feels hackathon-appropriate.
- `work/repos/billmnguyen-fretlab/index.html:1-168` delivers the “FRET-LAB Ultimate Sync Mode” landing view (Tailwind styling, audio loader, playback controls, YouTube simulator modal) that markets the experience as live-sync chord/lyric guidance for guitarists.
- `work/repos/billmnguyen-fretlab/index.html:189-405` shows the song database plus UI/metadata helpers, jsmediatags integration, and a sync loop that highlights lyric lines while audio plays—features that justify the product pitch and fit within a single-file hackathon demo.
- `work/repos/billmnguyen-fretlab/index.html:410-487` wires up file selection, modal flows, playback controls, and initial state so the entire experience runs client-side, which matches what a solo or small AI-assisted team could ship during a short event.

Overall authenticity assessment: looks consistent with a hackathon project
